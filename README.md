# Phage Proteomic Tree
This is a repository for all of my scripts associated with building the phage proteomic tree -- the overwhelming majority of which is derived from Rob's rundown, [found here](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/research/how-to-create-a-phage-proteomic-tree/).

Oh, and if you haven't already, check out the [Phage Proteomic Tree paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142423).
